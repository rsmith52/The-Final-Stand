Town Updates! (Kim)

(3/18) I added sketches for Beacon and Latia 

Beacon I thought that a more structured, symmetrical layout would fit the city, with a fancy tall lighthouse capital building. The houses would have more pointed / tall rooftops

Latia, being a water city, would be nifty to have on water where most of the buildings are out at water, utilzing wooden piers, planks, etc. to connect buildings. A few buildings would be on land, but close to the shore. 

(3/24) Added sketches for Nightglow, Phospher, and Torch! 

Nightglow is an air town, so a town on the top of a mountain would where it's known to be more windy would make sense for the city I think. Round buildings would have less wind resistance too.

Phospher is a combintation of 'nature' and 'rock' to make our final element 'earth', so creating a town that is surrounded by greenery/forest and the actual town contains a mixture of stone, wood, and foliage. I forgot to add, but having ivy or vines on the buildings would be interesting! The architecture is inspired by more medieval style. 

Torch would rely more on a red/orange color pallet to emphesize the fire element it represents.
