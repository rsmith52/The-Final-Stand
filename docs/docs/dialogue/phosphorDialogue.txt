Sedi

Hiya! Name's Sedi. I should be chasin'
a bite to eat in the forest right now,
but apparently there's a problem here,
and you're proof enough of that...

Don't try anythin' funny, Beacon buddy!
I've already spotted 6 of your weak points. 
And I didn't need fancy magic to do that, 
unlike my brother!

[yes]
Right! Leave these critters to me.

[no]
Copy that.

I gotta go to The Beacon after this?
Man, you can miss me with that city life. 
I'll set up a hammock in the trees.

Seta

Greetings, I'm Seta. My books said that
Beaconites don't interact with other towns,
but here you are! As if things hadn't
gotten awry enough around here.

Thankfully, I can stay far from the fight:
my bow's a state-of-the-art bullseye finder. 
I can use some charms to keep myself safe, too.
I'm not reckless like my sister! 

[yes]
Just focus on what's in front of you, 
I'll have your back!

[no]
Very well.

[2]
I have to evacuate to the Beacon or face
impending doom? Hope you all have an archery
range, or I'm building one over there myself.

Rem

Hello dear, call me Rem! There's some
trouble going on, but if ya get hurt, I can 
transmute some raw material from the forest
into something that can heal ya.

Kids run wild in these parts, but they always
run to me when they get injured! I've had to
save some from wild beasts in the past, too...

[yes]
Sure, I'll help ya!

[no]
See ya!

[2]
I'll make sure these rascals get to the Beacon 
safely.

Anvimtat

Hey...

My name's Anvimtat, the druid.

I've seen you running around, as an eagle,
and I've smelled you running around too, 
as a wolf...

I'm cool with eagles and wolves.

I mean, I can turn into them...

[yes]
Alright, I'll help you out if it
means protecting the animals...

[no]
I'll let the animals know about this
Darkness stuff, thanks...
