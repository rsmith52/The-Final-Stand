Intro 1

In the region of Lumina lies six towns,

but five towns depend on the so-called capital at its center: a small utopia called The Beacon.
--
Intro 2

Characterized by its giant, towering lighthouse, The Beacon has used its light magic to allow all sources of light in the region to shine brighter and longer than they ever could before.

This energy that The Beacon provides is important for 
the survival of the other towns: Nightglow, Torch, Amp,
Latia, and Phosphor. These are the air, fire, electric,
water, and earth villages.

Intro 3

The Beacon isn’t well-regarded by its neighbors,
however.

It's a closed-off society whose residents don't know 
much of the outside world, and don't really care
to. Yet they still impose their magic onto everyone...
--
Intro 4

This hatred for The Beacon has brought negative energy 
to Lumina, fueling an evil spirit known as 
The Darkness.

At this very moment, The Darkness has begun to grow and
take over Lumina, destroying everything in its path 
to make the region its home. It’s closing in on 
The Beacon, the subject of this negative energy.


The Lantern Holder, ruler of The Beacon, 
sees this first and realizes that The Beacon 
needs help from heroes in the neighboring towns.

Intro End

However, no one in The Beacon 
knows where exactly these towns are...

You must be The Beacon's first and only diplomat!
What is your name?

It'll be dangerous out there. You can defend yourself,
right? You're a...

TLH
Hello hero...

In this prototype your goal is to reach the
water town. First you will leave The Beacon
and enter the wilderness.

Exit to the left.
After some searching, you'll reach Latia, 
the water village.

Adskium

A stranger approaches Adskium, a look of strick determination on their face. What will this mean for our hero?

Oh! Sorry. I was lost in the novel of my life for a bit there. Who are you, and what brings another brave soul out here?

I see! The world ending! Darkness spreading! Such drama! It's incredible!

Alright, no need to beg further! You require the protagonist, Adskium, to join you on this journey.

With a hero like me on your side, the world will surely be saved. What an amazing sotry this will be!

Manu

Ahoy! I'm Manuherikia, legendary pirate.
Call me Manu. Ye must've heard of me.

What? Ye haven't? Argh. Ye must hail from
The Beacon, then...that blasted lighthouse 
of yers made yer seas impossible to

Blimey...

Neri

Look at that, a Beacon Batfish. The fish 
are evil lately. I could use them.
We'll kill them, yes? 

Darkness? I can help yes, but only if the
Batfish gets me something good in return,
like all the fish in the capital, yes.

[yes]
Interesting, yes.

[no]
No?

[2]
Interesting. No evil fish for me.

Lateralis

Not quite cold enough here for my liking.
Oh hey, I'm Lateralis. You don't look like
anyone I've met before.

You're from The Beacon? That giant ball of
heat that makes ice magic so hard 
to do? And you want MY help?

A great Darkness...well I'll join you, if
I can talk to your leader on behalf of
sad Cryomancers everywhere.

[yes]
Let's do it then.

[no]
K.

[2]
Oh, you'll still let me into the Beacon?
To evacuate?
Cool...
