Torka

You look like Beak. Beaks not welcome
here. Unless Beak wants to fight...

Beak want to fight monsters?

Hmm...

That is fight. That work for Torka.

[yes]
Torka use Axe for weapon. Axe take care 
of monsters first and Beak second.

[no]
Torka better at fight than Beak will ever
be.

[2]
Torka expect monsters to take care of Beak.
Torch monsters strongest monsters...

Torka go to Beak town if Beak come back
alive.

Yo what's up? You're talking to the
greatest blacksmith in Lumina. Do
you have any idea who I am? Not
likely for you, Beak.

Let me tell you something, pal.
If you're gonna fight the monsters here,
you'll need better equipment than that.
Beaksmiths don't know what they're doing.

[yes]
Wise choice. Wouldn't do much good if
the lone Beak in the world died on
the job, right?

[no]
Don't say I didn't warn you, pal.

[2]
You got my brother to go along with you?
Let him take care of the work. He's using 
my stuff after all.

I better see him again, pal. You? Ehhhhhh

I'm not your pal, pal.

Fire is pretty.
The world is much prettier
when covered in flames.

[yes]
The sun and earth will soon become the same!

[no]
Searing, blazing, glowing, charring, beauty!

[2]
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha hA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA HA!

Well met, stranger! I don't get to say
that often. You must be from The Beacon!

I'm a wandering monk dedicated to serving
all living creatures in Lumina. Many know 
me for my good deeds.

In a past life, though, I was serving these 
hands as a boxing champion! I'll lay down a
flurry of punches as a good deed if I need
to!

[yes]
We got no time to lose. Let's train!

[no]
Well, I'll be on my way! I'll make sure 
to let people know about your plight.
