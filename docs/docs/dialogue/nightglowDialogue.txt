Anders

Hello, I'm Anders. Head of Nightglow.
We've been expecting your arrival for
a while now.

Whenever we send a diplomat over to
the Beacon, they get turned away.
So, you must be here for something
important, if not a threat.

What brings you to Nightglow?

An evil spirit...consuming all in
its path...closing in on the Beacon?
You want to evacuate my citizens and
you want me to fight the Darkness?

...It brought the monsters here?

Very well. I will aid you for the
good of my town, if you help us
get rid of the monsters. I'll get
my sword. 

[yes]
For Nightglow.

[no]
Alright.

[2]
Right. I'll make everyone evacuate.
See you at the Beacon.

Oh, don't mind my husband. He's
a sweetheart underneath his cold
kingly exterior! It's his way of
ruling.

For him, Nightglow is a town. For
me, it's a family spanning all of
Lumina. And do I see a new member 
in front of my eyes?

Maybe. You can earn my trust by
helping our people get rid of
these monsters.

[yes]
Of course I'll help! Good choice
for the trust-building thing.

[no]
Hmm...

[2]
Let's do what's best for the people!
In Nightglow and all of Lumina!

Venus

Pleased to meet you. My codename is Venus.
This isn't my actual appearance, but a
disguise. By day I'm an ordinary citizen,
by night I'm a world-renowned thief.

Quick as wind, I've amassed quite the
collection of rare and valuable goods.
Breaking out of prison is easier than
painting my nails.

Never have I succesfully taken from the
Beacon, however. A giant spotlight at
the center of town doesn't make my life
so easy over there.

[yes]
These monsters won't know what hit them!

[no]
I'll be seeing you again. You'll never
see me again, though!

[2]
Sure, I'll go to the Beacon. Not unusual
for me.

Come stranger, let me read your palm, or
your future inside my crystal ball. Do
you like the smell? It's lavender!
I like that you can taste it, too.

My magic smoke can calm the harshest of
tempers! Human, animal, spirit, it
doesn't matter! 

[yes]
Ooooo, this journey would be good for
business.

[no]
Carry on, stranger.
