Anders

Thanks to US, Lumina is safe. Remember that, diplomat!
And remember that we must work together to rebuild what
was lost.

(You)
I will, Anders!

Lausanne

Thanks for protecting our family. This is just the
beginning of our work, though! It's time for
Lumina to unify greater than ever before.

(You)
It is indeed, Lausanne!

Venus

Ahhh! Without these monsters running around, I can
get back to my cunning thievery. Monsters are dumb,
but people are dumber!

I'll see you around...you won't be seeing me, though. 
I gotta go loot some ruins. Keep The Beacon open,
won't you?

(You)
For sure, Venus!

Torka

Beak good after all. Torka proud of Beak.

(You)
I'm proud of you too, Torka!

Torqa

We did pretty good. I mean things aren't
perfect, but at least things are still things,
you feel me?

We're all gonna need each other. Beaks can't
stay thinking they're better than everyone,
and this Darkness stuff proved that, pal.

(You)
I agree, Torqa!

--
Torca

I am glad to live,
to see the world so empty,
to cover in flames!

(You)
Well said, Torca!

Manuherikia (Manu)

Yo-ho-ho urchin me boy! This journey
revived a spirit in an old bloke. Manu
will rule the seas again!

(You)
Cheers, Manu!

Lateralis

Well...I'm glad I'm alive and that things
are colder for a bit. Maybe this is a place
for ice magic after all.

Dim that light magic of yours though, will you?

(You)
You bet, Lateralis!

Neritoides

Interesting. Darkness is finally gone, yes?
The Beacon Batfish gets me something good in
return, yes? Like all the fish here, yes?

(You)
Yes, Neritoides!

--
Hum

We can rebuild this place with a great
amount of energy put to great use. 

Hum.

(You)
That's right, Hum.

Buzz

Geez that was really intense I'm really glad
to see that it's all over hey you did something
good which I wasn't expecting so I guess that's
a start toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat

Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

(You)
Thank you, Buzz!

--
Zap

YES! The Darkness is GONE! Just like THAT!

If it shows up AGAIN, I'll deal with it like...

ZAP!

(You)
Sounds good, Zap!

--
Sedi

Good job, Beacon buddy. You wouldn't have lasted in the
wilderness without your Phosphor pals, though. Remember that! 

I'm going back into the trees!

(You)
See you, Sedi!

--
Seta

I've written dubiously about the events that
transpired here. It's a relief, but we
can never forget the day Lumina almost fell.
As well as those who lost their lives.

This will never happen again! Understand, diplomat?

(You)
I understand, Seta!

--
Rem

With so many injured, I have some work to do!
I'll need a lot of helping hands to turn the
ruins of Lumina back into the beautiful region
it was before The Darkness arrived.

Let's repair the broken bones of Lumina itself!

(You)
I wish you the best, Rem!

Aranfry

My magic smoke kept the civilians calm 
during this battle, and now business is 
going to be better than ever! I'm selling
this stuff by the bottle. Thanks stranger.

You can find me by going in the opposite
direction of any lavender-smelling fellow
you encounter in Lumina. Let me give you
a prophecy sometime...

(You)
Someday, Aranfry!

--
Adskium

Just like in the greatest novels, the main
hero, Adskium, has saved the day! The world
will see plays about him long after he's gone!
Such a wonderful story!

(You)
Hurrah, Adskium!

--
Anvimtat

Thanksssssssss, I mean thanks. I was
in snake mode...the animals have been
very grateful for our efforts...

(You)
Good to hear, Anvimtat!

--
Aslono

Thanks to us, the world is saved!
That's the goodest deed of them all.
Even if it takes a few punches!

(You)
Totally, Aslono!
